**Data Structures and Algorithmic Techniques** ðŸ“šðŸ’¡
=================================================

This section presents solutions to various problems related to fundamental data structures and algorithmic techniques commonly encountered in software engineering.

**Problem Categories:** ðŸ“‚

The problems are organized into subdirectories based on the primary topic they cover:

*   **Advanced Search Trees:** Problems involving more complex tree structures like AVL trees.
*   **Dictionaries and Abstract Data Types:** Problems utilizing dictionaries, hash maps, and other ADTs.
*   **Graphs and Partition Structures:** Problems related to graph traversal, connectivity, and partitioning (e.g., disjoint sets).
*   **Greedy Algorithms:** Problems solvable using greedy approaches.
*   **Priority Queues and Heaps:** Problems involving priority queues and heap data structures.
*   **Search Trees:** Problems focused on binary search trees and related concepts.

*Note: While the directory names might still be in Spanish, the problem statements within each subfolder are provided in English.*
