**Console Applications Showcase** 💻
=================================

This directory contains a collection of classic games and applications implemented as console-based C++ programs. Each project resides in its own subfolder.

**What projects are included?** 🤔

*   🪙 **1. Chinese Game:** An implementation of the traditional guessing game "Los Chinos". Players try to guess the total number of coins hidden in everyone's hands (0 to 3 coins per player).

*   🧠🌈 **2. Simon Says:** The classic electronic memory game. Repeat the sequence of colors (and sounds) generated by the machine. The sequence gets longer as you succeed!

*   🧩 **3. Peg Solitaire (Uno Solo / Senku):** A board game where you jump pegs over others to remove them. The goal is to leave only one peg, specifically in a target hole in this version.

*   🎮🌐 **4. Online Game Manager:** A system for managing 2-player online games (Connect 4). Features include user registration, login, matchmaking by skill level, ongoing game management, and win/loss tracking with category promotion/demotion.

*   🚀🎮 **5. Online Game Manager 2.0:** An enhanced version of the game manager with:
    *   ⏳ Automatic closure of inactive games (over 30 days).
    *   📜 Game history saved to `historico.txt`.
    *   📊 Statistics tracking against specific opponents.
    *   🔧 Internal design improvements (dynamic arrays, pointer-based game access).
